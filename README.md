<p style="font-family:arial">Publishing to me is freedom; <li><b>freedom</b> of sharing my creativity in stories</li><li> <b>breaking</b> the chains that hold myself and my anxiety oh, so closely.</li><li> Writing is a means of <b>escaping</b> and publishing is the feeling of freedom that washes over once the escape was successful. 

<p>The journey of self-publishing my first book, <i>Drop Me</i>, was stressful, only because I had no clue what I was doing. I spent the money for someone to edit the cover and I edited the pages and the format (there might be typos yet). I did so much research to make sure my book came out perfectly, and I feel it came out as anything but. </p>

<p>For my next book, whatever or whenever I might publish it, I’d like to go the route of getting an agent. And to have someone as passionate as publishing my work as me. </p>

Reflection 
This project was more frustrating side for me. The word “simple” kept being used and I feel as though that was the wrong word to use, as people who are not technologically smart (especially for the means of creating a website and the language behind it) was very hard to wrap my head around. I had no idea what I was doing, even with the videos. Once I played around with the website and all the buttons, I guess it became a little easier to understand it all. But for someone with no prior knowledge of anything to do with creating a website, it was very frustrating. Espeically the word choice “simple.” All in all, it is cool to see all that hard work and frustration end up as a website, even if it seems very unprofessionally done and such. Since I had access denied to the  “Getting Your Site Up and Running” video, I struggled with the document that was meant to help me navigate the website. I couldn’t find the “page” tab  for a few minutes and was ready to throw in the towel, when it finally appeared. I swear it showed up out of nowhere, but I most likely overlooked the placement of it or something. Overall, the website is cool it see int the end, but it was a very frustrating process to get it to that point.
