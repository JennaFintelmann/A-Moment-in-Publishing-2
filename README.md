<h1>A Moment In Publishing</h1>
<p style="font-family:arial">Publishing to me is freedom; <li><b>freedom</b> of sharing my creativity in stories</li><li> <b>breaking</b> the chains that hold myself and my anxiety oh, so closely.</li><li> Writing is a means of <b>escaping</b> and publishing is the feeling of freedom that washes over once the escape was successful.

<p>The journey of self-publishing my first book, <i>Drop Me</i>, was stressful, only because I had no clue what I was doing. I spent the money for someone to edit the cover and I edited the pages and the format (there might be typos yet). I did so much research to make sure my book came out perfectly, and I feel it came out as anything but. </p>

<p>For my next book, whatever or whenever I might publish it, Iâ€™d like to go the route of getting an agent. And to have someone as passionate as publishing my work as me. </p>
